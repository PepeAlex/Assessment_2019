> This assessment is research about TIPS Dataset to Fundamentals of Data Analysis by Dr. Ian McLoughlin as lecturer. I have written some Python codes to describe this dataset and I used some Python’s libraries and Jupyter as part of current project. This project was delivered in two parts, first was create a git repository that describe statistic and plots of the data; and the second  discusses and analyses whether there is a relationship between the total bill and tip amount.
